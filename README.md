# Layout Engines for Eclipse Sprotty

This project provides layout engines (through the `IModelLayoutEngine` interface) for the frontend (client) part of [Eclipse Sprotty](http://github.com/eclipse/sprotty). Currently only one layout engine is provided: the [Eclipse Layout Kernel (ELK)](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/).

The version history is documented in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/eclipse/sprotty-layout/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
